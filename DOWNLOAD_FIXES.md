# Download System Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Available Downloads Page - Purchased Designs Not Showing

**Problem:**

- Purchased designs were not displaying properly in the available-downloads page
- The page was only fetching designs when user had active subscription
- Design data structure mismatch - purchases contain design objects, not just IDs

**Solution:**

- Changed `useGetDesignsQuery` to always fetch (removed `skip: !hasActiveSubscription`)
- Fixed purchased designs extraction:
  - Created a `Set` of purchased design IDs from purchases
  - Filter all designs based on purchased IDs
  - This ensures we can match designs correctly
- Updated logic to show:
  - **Purchased filter**: Only designs user has purchased
  - **Subscription filter**: All designs (only visible if has subscription)
  - **All filter**: All designs for subscription users, only purchased for non-subscription users

**Files Modified:**

- `src/app/dashboard/available-downloads/page.tsx`

```typescript
// Before: Design objects were mapped incorrectly
const purchasedDesigns = purchases.map((p: Purchase) => p.design);

// After: Create a Set of IDs and filter from all designs
const purchasedDesignIds = new Set(
  purchases
    .filter((p) => p.purchaseType === "individual" && p.design && ...)
    .map((p) => p.design?._id)
    .filter(Boolean)
);
const purchasedDesigns = allDesigns.filter((design) =>
  purchasedDesignIds.has(design._id)
);
```

### 2. ✅ Download Button Not Working

**Problem:**

- Download functionality was implemented but designs weren't being fetched properly
- Purchased designs couldn't be identified for download access

**Solution:**

- Fixed the design fetching to always load designs
- Corrected the `isPurchased` check to use the `purchasedDesignIds` Set
- This ensures the download button appears and works for purchased designs

**Files Modified:**

- `src/app/dashboard/available-downloads/page.tsx`

### 3. ✅ User Profile - Real Backend Stats

**Problem:**

- User profile dropdown showed no real information
- Missing stats like total purchases, downloads, subscription status

**Solution:**

- Added API queries to fetch real data:
  - `useGetMyPurchasesQuery` - Get total purchases count
  - `useGetMyDownloadsQuery` - Get total downloads count
  - `useGetSubscriptionStatusQuery` - Get subscription status
- Added stats section to profile dropdown showing:
  - **Purchases count** (e.g., "5 Purchases")
  - **Downloads count** (e.g., "12 Downloads")
  - **Subscription badge** ("✓ Subscribed" if active)

**Files Modified:**

- `src/components/UserProfile.tsx`

**Added Features:**

```tsx
// Stats Section in Profile Dropdown
<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-3 text-center">
  <div>
    <p className="text-lg font-bold">{totalPurchases}</p>
    <p className="text-xs">Purchases</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p className="text-lg font-bold">{totalDownloads}</p>
    <p className="text-xs">Downloads</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

### 4. ✅ Dashboard - Enhanced Subscription Info

**Problem:**

- Dashboard showed basic "Yes/No" for subscription
- No details about plan name or remaining downloads

**Solution:**

- Enhanced subscription stat to show plan name instead of "Yes/No"
- Changed stat value from "Yes/No" to actual plan name (e.g., "Premium Plan")
- Changed color dynamically (green for active, gray for no plan)
- Added dedicated subscription info card showing:
  - Plan name
  - Remaining downloads (or "Unlimited")
  - Visual indicator with Sparkles icon

**Files Modified:**

- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Added Features:**

```tsx
// Subscription Info Card (shown when active)
{
  hasActiveSubscription && (
    <div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-green-500 to-emerald-600">
      <h3>Active Subscription</h3>
      <p>Plan: {subscriptionPlanName}</p>
      <p>
        {remainingDownloads === -1
          ? "Unlimited"
          : `${remainingDownloads} remaining`}
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Testing Checklist

### Available Downloads Page

- [ ] Login with account that has purchased designs
- [ ] Verify purchased designs show in "Purchased" tab
- [ ] Click on a purchased design's "Download Now" button
- [ ] Verify download starts successfully
- [ ] Login with subscription account
- [ ] Verify all designs show in "All Designs" and "Subscription Access" tabs
- [ ] Verify purchased designs have "Purchased" badge
- [ ] Verify non-purchased designs have "Subscription" badge

### User Profile Stats

- [ ] Open user profile dropdown in header
- [ ] Verify "Purchases" count matches actual purchases
- [ ] Verify "Downloads" count matches download history
- [ ] If subscribed, verify "✓ Subscribed" badge appears
- [ ] If not subscribed, verify badge doesn't appear

### Dashboard Stats

- [ ] Navigate to dashboard home
- [ ] Verify "Total Purchases" shows correct count
- [ ] Verify "Total Downloads" shows correct count
- [ ] Verify "Subscription" shows plan name if active
- [ ] If subscribed, verify green subscription info card appears
- [ ] Verify card shows plan name and remaining downloads

## API Endpoints Used

1. **GET** `/purchases/my-purchases?page=1&limit=100`

   - Returns: List of user purchases with design details
   - Used for: Identifying purchased designs

2. **GET** `/designs?page=1&limit=12&status=Active`

   - Returns: All active designs
   - Used for: Showing available designs in grid

3. **GET** `/downloads/my-downloads?page=1&limit=1`

   - Returns: Download history with pagination
   - Used for: Getting total downloads count

4. **GET** `/downloads/subscription-status`

   - Returns: Subscription status, plan info, remaining downloads
   - Used for: Showing subscription details

5. **POST** `/downloads/design/:designId`
   - Returns: Download URL for the design
   - Used for: Triggering design download

## Data Flow

```
User Purchases Design
    ↓
Backend creates Purchase record (purchaseType: "individual", design: {...})
    ↓
Frontend fetches /purchases/my-purchases
    ↓
Extract design IDs from purchases
    ↓
Fetch all designs from /designs
    ↓
Filter designs where design._id is in purchasedDesignIds
    ↓
Display in Available Downloads page with "Purchased" badge
    ↓
User clicks "Download Now"
    ↓
POST /downloads/design/:designId (backend checks access)
    ↓
Backend returns download URL
    ↓
Frontend opens URL in new tab
```

## Technical Improvements

1. **Better Type Safety**: Used TypeScript interfaces from `@/types/dashboard`
2. **Efficient Lookups**: Used `Set` for O(1) lookup of purchased design IDs
3. **Proper Data Fetching**: Always fetch designs, filter based on access
4. **Real-time Stats**: Profile and dashboard pull live data from backend
5. **Clear Visual Indicators**: Badges show purchase vs subscription access
6. **Better UX**: Loading states, error handling, and user feedback

## Known Limitations

1. **Pagination**: Currently fetches first 100 purchases (should be enough for most users)
2. **Cache**: Stats update on page load/refresh (consider adding real-time updates)
3. **Download Tracking**: Downloads are tracked in backend, frontend just triggers

## Future Enhancements

1. Add infinite scroll for purchased designs
2. Add search/filter functionality in available downloads
3. Show download progress bar
4. Add "Recently Downloaded" section
5. Show subscription expiry date
6. Add download analytics (most downloaded, etc.)
