// Runtime validation
if (formData.comment.trim().length < 10) {
  alert("Comment must be at least 10 characters long");
  return;
}
```

### Backend Validation (Zod)

```typescript
// Backend automatically validates:
- Design exists and not deleted
- User has completed purchase
- Comment 10-1000 chars
- Title 5-100 chars (optional)
- Rating 1-5 integer
- No duplicate reviews per user/design
```

### Authorization

- ✅ Users can only review **completed** purchases
