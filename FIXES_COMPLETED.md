## 🎯 Issues Resolved

### 1. **Authentication Persistence on Reload** ✅

- **Problem**: Page reload was redirecting to login even when authenticated
- **Solution**: Fixed `AuthWrapper` to only logout on 401/403 errors, not network errors
- **Result**: Users stay authenticated after reload in admin and dashboard panels

### 2. **Logout Functionality** ✅

- **Problem**: Logout wasn't clearing all authenticated state immediately
- **Solution**:
  - Complete API cache reset with `resetApiState()`
  - Proper Redux state clearing
  - Force page reload with `window.location.href`
- **Result**: All authentication cleared instantly, Login/Signup buttons appear immediately

### 3. **User Profile Display** ✅

- **Problem**: User profiles not properly displayed in admin/dashboard panels
- **Solution**: Enhanced sidebars with:
  - User avatar with gradient background
  - Name, email, and role badge
  - Improved styling and mobile responsiveness
- **Result**: Beautiful user profile sections in both panels

### 4. **Header Consistency** ✅

- **Problem**: Header needed consistent styling and proper navigation
- **Solution**: Updated `UserProfile` component with:
  - Gradient-styled dropdown
  - Working navigation links
  - Role-based menu items
  - Proper logout handling
- **Result**: Professional, consistent header across all pages
